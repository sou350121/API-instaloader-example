# API/instaloader-master-example

The reason of you found this folder is probably because of having no idea to use API _'instaloader'_. 

This file contains some example with a quite holistic explanation for using the API.

hope them helps!!

# Before using it, please make sure you can import the API properly. #
 I put the example .py file inside the dir of the API indeed.
